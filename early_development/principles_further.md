## Further development

```{epigraph}
Automation *is* documentation.

```

The founding three principles above are reliant on a wider context.
Analysis does not sit in a vacuum - it relies on a culture that values high quality analysis and supports it.
In addition to reproducibility, auditability and quality assurance, we value adaptability and sustainability too.
Adaptability guarantees that work done now will have value in the future.
Sustainability guarantees that work done now will not diminish in quality or relevance over time.

### Adaptable

Analysis must be available to be reused or repurposed for other needs.

Data sources change in shape or substance frequently.
Analysis products should be able to adapt to those changes in the data source.

```{todo}
Complete the Adaptable principles.

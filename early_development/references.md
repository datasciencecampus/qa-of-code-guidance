## Examples in government

Here we point to examples which apply good practices, from across government.

Other guidance from across government:
* [Department for Education good code practice](https://dfe-analytical-services.github.io/good-code-practice/index.html)


## Government blog posts

* [Pair programming](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2018/02/06/how-to-pair-program-effectively-in-6-steps/)

## Troubleshooting code

When asking for help from your peers or online communities like [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), it's best to provide a [minimal, reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example).
Without a simplified example, it can be difficult to diagnose your problem and suggest potential solutions.
You might even find that breaking the problem down to simplify the example leads you to a solution.

* We're all guilty of using tools without reading the manual - give it a search
* [Google](https://www.google.co.uk)
* [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
* Reach out to communities, like the [Government Data Science Slack](https://govdatascience.slack.com)
* Take a break - come back at it with a clear head


## Machine learning

Although machine learning is not tackled specifically in this guidance, many of the good practices outlined here are applicable.

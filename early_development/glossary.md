* Referential transparency - the fact that a function can be replaced with it's output value without changing the result of the program.
* Parameter - the arguments that a function or method expects to be provided when it is called.
* Argument - a value which is being passed to a program, function or class.

* Object-oriented programming (OOP) - defining and using objects that contain both data (attributes) and logic (methods).

* Dependencies - something that your analysis depends on. This includes your operating system, environment, software and packages (and their versions), if these are needed to reproducibly run your analysis code.

* Application Programming Interface (API) - an interface that defines how you can interact with software. For example, the functions or methods from a package that a typical user will interact with.

* Assured -
* Auditable - 
* Reproducibile - produces the same results, given the same analysis and the same data.
* Quality assurance - 


* Readability - ability to gain an understanding of code within a reasonable amount of time.
* Maintainability - ability to easily understand (see Readability), modify and repair the code.
* Extensibility - ability to build upon or extend the functionality of code.


* Documentation - Human readable text that describes an aspect of your code. Low level documentation might describe a single function, while high level documentation might describe your overall approach to a piece of analysis.
* Dependency - something that is required for your code to run correctly - your code depends upon it.
* Abstraction - treating a problem as an idea or concept, rather than a detailed individual example.
